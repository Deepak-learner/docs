## Auto-join

When you create a Team, it can have Auto-join channels – channels to which the team members are automatically added. It reduces extra work with handling users and the channels where they must be included. It’s also handy for onboarding purposes and teams with a large number of different channels.

For instance, you can use Auto-join to quickly include new members who have just joined the company to specific onboarding channels. Or you could set Auto-join to automatically include team members in company-related channels, such as channels meant to share updates and company news.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can mark a channel **Auto-join** for members to join them automatically, once they join a team.
